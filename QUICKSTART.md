## Tips

1. **Resume Naming**: Resumes are automatically named with timestamps. You'll see names like `resume_1729275840123_1`

2. **Managing Resumes**: You can delete old resumes using the "Delete" button next to each resume

3. **Multiple Job Descriptions**: You can analyze the same set of resumes against different JDs

4. **Analysis Storage**: All analyses are saved to the database for future reference

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Use PDF format only
   - Ensure PDFs are text-based (not scanned images)
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB each)

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check if `backend/.env` exists and has valid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Ensure port 3001 is not already in use
- Check backend terminal for error messages

### Frontend won't start
- Ensure port 3000 is not already in use
- Try `cd frontend && rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Upload fails
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check if PDF is valid and text-based
- Check backend terminal for errors

### Analysis takes too long
- Each resume takes 30-60 seconds to analyze
- For 5 resumes, expect 2.5-5 minutes total
- This is normal for free tier API usage

### Can't see detailed analysis
- Click on the resume card in the results section
- Scroll down to see detailed breakdown
- If analysis shows "raw" field, the AI response may not have been proper JSON
